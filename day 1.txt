// Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,
 it blocks all the other resources behind it.
. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data
 at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

.HTTP/1.1

The flow control mechanism in HTTP/1.1 relies on the basic TCP connection. 
In beginning itself, both the machines set their buffer sizes automatically. If the receiverâ€™s buffer is full
, it shares the receive window details, telling how much available space is left.
 The receiver acknowledges the same and sends an opening signal
Note that flow control can only be implemented on either end of the connection. Moreover, since HTTP/1.1 uses
 a TCP connection, each connection demands an individual flow control mechanism.

 HTTP/2

It multiplexes data streams utilizing the same (one) TCP connection.
 So, in this case, both machines can implement their flow controls instead of using the transport layer.
  The application layer shares the available buffer size data, after which, 
  both machines set their receive window details on the multiplexed streams level. 
  In addition, the flow control mechanism does not need to wait for the signal to reach its destination before modifying
   the receive window.

//Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to 
that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
 The variables don't actually store the value.

 In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character. 
 The internal format for strings is always UTF-16, it is not tied to the page encoding
